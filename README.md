# LUMASim - WIP
This is just a simple simulation of a balloon flight specifically to be used with the UAH Space Hardware Club Project LUMA.

## What Exactly is it?
It is a balloon simulation written in MATLAB. It takes in some input parameters and then generates a graph of altitude vs time.
<br>
The plan is to have a plain balloon flight simulation and also one for LUMA specifically that allows the user to specify an altitude to begin removing helium, a rate of the helium escaping, and an amount of time that the helium will escape. 
This way, the LUMA team can model the flights beforehand and know when they need to vent helium and for how long.

## To Do
- [x] Simulate the standard atmosphere
- [ ] Simulate a normal balloon flight
- [ ] Simulate a venting of helium
- [ ] Automatically optimize helium venting \(This is a very distant goal\)
